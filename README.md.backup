# Pretty-Shitty-Proxy
This is a proxy server written in golang. I'll use this for malware analysis and for analysing the requests.

## Setup

1) You need Golang for this to work<br>
2) You need gonfig for the proxy to be able to read from the configuration file<br>

### Installing gonfig

Gonfig can be installed as follows :

```
go get github.com/tkanos/gonfig
```

The config file looks as follows : 


## Usage 

```
go run psp.go
```

 

**Note** : It currently does not have support for HTTPS.
