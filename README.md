# Pretty-Shitty-Proxy
This is a proxy server written in golang. I'll use this for malware analysis and for analysing the requests.

## Usage 

```
go run psp.go
```

The proxy will start running on port 1331. Set your browsers or some other device's port to 1331. 

**Note** : It currently does not have support for HTTPS.
